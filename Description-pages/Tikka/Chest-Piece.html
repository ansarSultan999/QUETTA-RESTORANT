    <p>
        The chest piece, also known as the chicken breast, is a versatile and widely consumed cut of chicken. It is a lean meat option that is known for its tender texture and mild flavor. Here's a description of the chest piece:

The chest piece is the front part of the chicken, specifically the meat that covers the breastbone. It is considered the leanest part of the chicken, as it has a lower fat content compared to other cuts like the leg or thigh.
