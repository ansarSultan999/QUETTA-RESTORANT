        Aloo Biryani, also known as Potato Biryani, is a delicious and flavorful rice dish that features the humble potato as the star ingredient. It is a popular vegetarian variation of the traditional biryani, and here's a full description of Aloo Biryani:

Aloo Biryani begins with fragrant basmati rice, which is washed and soaked to remove any excess starch. The soaked rice is then parboiled until it is about 70-80% cooked, ensuring that the grains remain firm and separate. This partially cooked rice will later be layered with the spiced potatoes to create a delectable biryani.
